# Advent of Code 2020 - pastly edition

I've "learned Rust" two or three times before. The most recent time I even got
into web assembly and make a cool thing[\*](). But I've taken a long break, so
this is going to be rather rusty code at the start (pun intended).

Running:

    cargo run --bin day1 < input/day1.txt

Explanations/thoughts/etc. are in the code.
